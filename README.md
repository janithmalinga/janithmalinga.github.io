## About Me

A little background about myself: I am currently an Application Security Engineer at Amazon. I have hands-on experience in application security, including secure design reviews, threat modeling, vulnerability assessments, and secure code reviews. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked closely with engineering teams to strengthen the security posture of large-scale, distributed systems.

In addition to my core responsibilities, I have also contributed to security education initiatives and collaborated on improving internal security processes.

My main areas of interest include web application security, threat modeling, and secure software development practices.
