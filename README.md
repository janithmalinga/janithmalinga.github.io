## About Me

A little background about myself; I am currently a security consultant employed in the [Eguardian Global Service](https://www.egscyber.com/). I have experience in information security involving security assessments, vulnerability management, and configuration management. For the past two years I have had the opportunity to perform security assessments and audits against enterprise-wide information security programs. In addition to performing security assessments, I have been involved with conducting digital forensic investigations in some policy violations.

My main research areas are Web application security, Network monitoring and social engineering.
