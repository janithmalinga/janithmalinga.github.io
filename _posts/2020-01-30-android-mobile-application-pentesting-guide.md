This article covers all the tools and technics used to conduct successfull android mobile application pentest.

Mobile application pentesting process can be devide into two main sub tasks,
1. Dynamic Analysis
2. Static Analysis

# Dynamic Analysis

## Tools I'm using

For the installation purpose I'm using genymotion emulator but some android applications can not be installed on emulators due to incompetible arm processors. In that situations I'm using a mobile phone to install the application but keep in mind if you use a mobile device it should be able to root the device.

Burpsuite is the proxy I'm using to intercept and modify the api calls. 

## Environment setup
Intercept the genymotion network traffic using burpsuite. Then install the mobile application apk file in emulator. In some projects I don't get the apk file from the client in that cases below are the sites I use to get the apk file,
```
apkmirror.com
apkmonk.com
```

## Analysis process


# Static Analysis

## Tools
Apktools
adb

## Pentesting roadmap


## MobSF Automated Scanning

MobSF is an excellent tool for conduct dynamic and static testing for Android/iOS/Windows mobile applications.

### Installation of MobSF

I use docker to run the tool since that way is too easy and secure. Here is the commands used,

Install Docker
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian buster stable | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
apt-get update
apt install docker-ce
```

Download MobSF Docker image(https://hub.docker.com/r/opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf/),
```
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
```
Run the image,
```
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
```
Now open your browser and goto http://0.0.0.0:8000
