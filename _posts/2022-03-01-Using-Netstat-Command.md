Netstat is a windows and unix based command used to get network statistics. If you are security professional you must use this command regularly. In this blog post I'm going to provide
some options you can use along with.

## Netstat commands

### Display all active ports (-a)
### List all TCP connections (-at)
### List all UDP connections (-au)
### List the listening ports (-l)
### Display the executable file or listening port (-b)
### Show statistics about network connection (-e)
### Display FQDN (-f)
### Display statistics for ports (-s)
### Display PID (-p)
### Print netstat info continuously (interval)
